# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Python 2D List
In this Python program, we create a Tic Tac Toe game played between two players, utilizing a 2D list to represent the game board. The 2D list acts as a 3x3 grid, where each cell corresponds to a position on the board.

Players take turns to make their moves, placing their respective symbols, typically 'P1' and 'P2,' on the grid until one player achieves a winning arrangement or the board becomes full, resulting in a draw.

The 2D list efficiently tracks the game's state, making it easy to update player moves and determine the winner. The game follows the classic rules of Tic Tac Toe, where a player wins by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three identical symbols.

The program handles player inputs, validates moves, and ensures fair gameplay between the two players. It displays the game board after each move, allowing players to see the progress of the game.

By using a 2D list, the program effectively manages the game's board, enabling smooth gameplay and providing an engaging experience for players. The simplicity of the implementation makes it a great introductory project for learning Python programming.
