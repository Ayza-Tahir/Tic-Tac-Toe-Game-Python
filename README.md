# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Python
In Python, we implement a Tic Tac Toe game with a 2D list as the board. Players place 'P1' and 'P2' symbols to win or draw. The 2D list tracks game state, displays the board after each move. Classic rules apply, making it perfect for learning Python. Enjoy this interactive and engaging gaming experience!
